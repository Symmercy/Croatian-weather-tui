# Croatian-weather-tui
## A tool for weather info (Croatia only) in the terminal

This is a small program I created to help me be informed about weather without going through websites.

## How to use

in the code change the PLACEHOLDER with the name of your city, for example if you are in Zagreb replace PLACEHOLDER with Zagreb
if you want to check names of weather stations you can download the file im pulling info from with the following command: wget https://vrijeme.hr/hrvatska1_n.xml.
after you change the PLACEHOLDER to the name of your city, you should run chmod +x weather && chmod +x weather-dmenu
you should put this program into /usr/bin, /bin or ~/.local/bin up to you!
